Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.\n\nUsing Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.\n\nFor example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications. The screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the Visual Studio Code text editor.\n\n\n\nYou can add Markdown formatting elements to a plaintext file using a text editor application. Or you can use one of the many Markdown applications for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android operating systems. There are also several web-based applications specifically designed for writing in Markdown.\n\nDepending on the application you use, you may not be able to preview the formatted document in real time. But that’s okay. According to Gruber, Markdown syntax is designed to be readable and unobtrusive, so the text in Markdown files can be read even if it isn’t rendered.\n\n\n  The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.\n\n\nWhy Use Markdown?\n\nYou might be wondering why people use Markdown instead of a WYSIWYG editor. Why write with Markdown when you can press buttons in an interface to format your text? As it turns out, there are several reasons why people use Markdown instead of WYSIWYG editors.\n\n\n  \n    Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.\n  \n  \n    Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. If you decide you don’t like the Markdown application you’re currently using, you can import your Markdown files into another Markdown application. That’s in stark contrast to word processing applications like Microsoft Word that lock your content into a proprietary file format.\n  \n  \n    Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.\n  \n  \n    Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it comes to books, university theses, and other milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.\n  \n  \n    Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.\n  \n\n\nKicking the Tires\n\nThe best way to get started with Markdown is to use it. That’s easier than ever before thanks to a variety of free tools.\n\nYou don’t even need to download anything. There are several online Markdown editors that you can use to try writing in Markdown. Dillinger is one of the best online Markdown editors. Just open the site and start typing in the left pane. A preview of the rendered document appears in the right pane.\n\n\n\nYou’ll probably want to keep the Dillinger website open as you read through this guide. That way you can try the syntax as you learn about it. After you’ve become familiar with Markdown, you may want to use a Markdown application that can be installed on your desktop computer or mobile device.\n\nHow Does it Work?\n\nDillinger makes writing in Markdown easy because it hides the stuff happening behind the scenes, but it’s worth exploring how the process works in general.\n\nWhen you write in Markdown, the text is stored in a plaintext file that has an .md or .markdown extension. But then what? How is your Markdown-formatted file converted into HTML or a print-ready document?\n\nThe short answer is that you need a Markdown application capable of processing the Markdown file. There are lots of applications available — everything from simple scripts to desktop applications that look like Microsoft Word. Despite their visual differences, all of the applications do the same thing. Like Dillinger, they all convert Markdown-formatted text to HTML so it can be displayed in web browsers.\n\nMarkdown applications use something called a Markdown processor (also commonly referred to as a “parser” or an “implementation”) to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format. At that point, your document can be viewed in a web browser or combined with a style sheet and printed. You can see a visual representation of this process below.\n\n\n   Note: The Markdown application and processor are two separate components. For the sake of brevity, I've combined them into one element (\"Markdown app\") in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\nTo summarize, this is a four-part process:\n\n\n  Create a Markdown file using a text editor or a dedicated Markdown application. The file should have an .md or .markdown extension.\n  Open the Markdown file in a Markdown application.\n  Use the Markdown application to convert the Markdown file to an HTML document.\n  View the HTML file in a web browser or use the Markdown application to convert it to another file format, like PDF.\n\n\nFrom your perspective, the process will vary somewhat depending on the application you use. For example, Dillinger essentially combines steps 1-3 into a single, seamless interface — all you have to do is type in the left pane and the rendered output magically appears in the right pane. But if you use other tools, like a text editor with a static website generator, you’ll find that the process is much more visible.\n\nWhat’s Markdown Good For?\n\nMarkdown is a fast and easy way to take notes, create content for a website, and produce print-ready documents.\n\nIt doesn’t take long to learn the Markdown syntax, and once you know how to use it, you can write using Markdown just about everywhere. Most people use Markdown to create content for the web, but Markdown is good for formatting everything from email messages to grocery lists.\n\nHere are some examples of what you can do with Markdown.\n\nWebsites\n\nMarkdown was designed for the web, so it should come as no surprise that there are plenty of applications specifically designed for creating website content.\n\nIf you’re looking for the simplest possible way to create a website with Markdown files, check out blot.im. After you sign up for Blot, it creates a Dropbox folder on your computer. Just drag and drop your Markdown files into the folder and — poof! — they’re on your website. It couldn’t be easier.\n\nIf you’re familiar with HTML, CSS, and version control, check out Jekyll, a popular static site generator that takes Markdown files and builds an HTML website. One advantage to this approach is that GitHub Pages provides free hosting for Jekyll-generated websites. If Jekyll isn’t your cup of tea, just pick one of the many other static site generators available.\n\n\n   Note: Shameless plug! If you want to learn how to build static websites from scratch, check out The Static Site Guide, another book I wrote.\n\n\nIf you’d like to use a content management system (CMS) to power your website, take a look at Ghost. It’s a free and open-source blogging platform with a nice Markdown editor. If you’re a WordPress user, you’ll be happy to know there’s Markdown support for websites hosted on WordPress.com. Self-hosted WordPress sites can use the Jetpack plugin.\n\nDocuments\n\nMarkdown doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of word processors like Microsoft Word, but it’s good enough for creating basic documents like assignments and letters. You can use a Markdown document authoring application to create and export Markdown-formatted documents to PDF or HTML file format. The PDF part is key, because once you have a PDF document, you can do anything with it — print it, email it, or upload it to a website.\n\nHere are some Markdown document authoring applications I recommend:\n\n\n  Mac: MacDown, iA Writer, or Marked 2\n  iOS / Android: iA Writer\n  Windows: ghostwriter or Markdown Monster\n  Linux: ReText or ghostwriter\n  Web: Dillinger or StackEdit\n\n\n\n   Tip: iA Writer provides templates for previewing, printing, and exporting Markdown-formatted documents. For example, the \"Academic – MLA Style\" template indents paragraphs and adds double sentence spacing.\n\n\nNotes\n\nIn nearly every way, Markdown is the ideal syntax for taking notes. Sadly, Evernote and OneNote, two of the most popular note applications, don’t currently support Markdown. The good news is that several other note applications do support Markdown:\n\n\n  Obsidian is a popular Markdown note-taking application loaded with features.\n  Simplenote is a free, barebones note-taking application available for every platform.\n  Notable is a note-taking application that runs on a variety of platforms.\n  Bear is an Evernote-like application available for Mac and iOS devices. It doesn’t exclusively use Markdown by default, but you can enable Markdown compatibility mode.\n  Joplin is a note taking application that respects your privacy. It’s available for every platform.\n  Boostnote bills itself as an “open source note-taking app designed for programmers.”\n\n\nIf you can’t part with Evernote, check out Marxico, a subscription-based Markdown editor for Evernote, or use Markdown Here with the Evernote website.\n\nBooks\n\nLooking to self-publish a novel? Try Leanpub, a service that takes your Markdown-formatted files and turns them into an electronic book. Leanpub outputs your book in PDF, EPUB, and MOBI file format. If you’d like to create paperback copies of your book, you can upload the PDF file to another service such as Kindle Direct Publishing. To learn more about writing and self-publishing a book using Markdown, read this blog post.\n\nPresentations\n\nBelieve it or not, you can generate presentations from Markdown-formatted files. Creating presentations in Markdown takes a little getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it’s a lot faster and easier than using an application like PowerPoint or Keynote. Remark (GitHub project) is a popular browser-based Markdown slideshow tool, as are Cleaver (GitHub project) and Marp (GitHub project). If you use a Mac and would prefer to use an application, check out Deckset or Hyperdeck.\n\nEmail\n\nIf you send a lot of email and you’re tired of the formatting controls available on most email provider websites, you’ll be happy to learn there’s an easy way to write email messages using Markdown. Markdown Here is a free and open-source browser extension that converts Markdown-formatted text into HTML that’s ready to send.\n\nCollaboration\n\nCollaboration and team messaging applications are a popular way of communicating with coworkers and friends at work and home. These applications don’t utilize all of Markdown’s features, but the features they do provide are fairly useful. For example, the ability to bold and italicize text without using the WYSIWYG interface is pretty handy. Slack, Discord, Wiki.js, and Mattermost are all good collaboration applications.\n\nDocumentation\n\nMarkdown is a natural fit for technical documentation. Companies like GitHub are increasingly switching to Markdown for their documentation — check out their blog post about how they migrated their Markdown-formatted documentation to Jekyll. If you write documentation for a product or service, take a look at these handy tools:\n\n\n  Read the Docs can generate a documentation website from your open source Markdown files. Just connect your GitHub repository to their service and push — Read the Docs does the rest. They also have a service for commercial entities.\n  MkDocs is a fast and simple static site generator that’s geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown and configured with a single YAML configuration file. MkDocs has several built in themes, including a port of the Read the Docs documentation theme for use with MkDocs. One of the newest themes is MkDocs Material.\n  Docusaurus is a static site generator designed exclusively for creating documentation websites. It supports translations, search, and versioning.\n  VuePress is a static site generator powered by Vue and optimized for writing technical documentation.\n  Jekyll was mentioned earlier in the section on websites, but it’s also a good option for generating a documentation website from Markdown files. If you go this route, be sure to check out the Jekyll documentation theme.\n\n\nFlavors of Markdown\n\nOne of the most confusing aspects of using Markdown is that practically every Markdown application implements a slightly different version of Markdown. These variants of Markdown are commonly referred to as flavors. It’s your job to master whatever flavor of Markdown your application has implemented.\n\nTo wrap your head around the concept of Markdown flavors, it might help to think of them as language dialects. People in New York City speak English just like the people in London, but there are substantial differences between the dialects used in both cities. The same is true for people using different Markdown applications. Using Dillinger to write with Markdown is a vastly different experience than using Ulysses.\n\nPractically speaking, this means you never know exactly what a company means when they say they support “Markdown.” Are they talking about only the basic syntax elements, or all of the basic and extended syntax elements combined, or some arbitrary combination of syntax elements? You won’t know until you read the documentation or start using the application.\n\nIf you’re just starting out, the best advice I can give you is to pick a Markdown application with good Markdown support. That’ll go a long way towards maintaining the portability of your Markdown files. You might want to store and use your Markdown files in other applications, and to do that you need to start with an application that provides good support. You can use the tool directory to find an application that fits the bill.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nThere are lots of resources you can use to learn Markdown.

It’s hard to see trailing whitespace in an editor, and many people accidentally or intentionally put two spaces after every sentence. For this reason, you may want to use something other than trailing whitespace for line breaks. If your Markdown application supports HTML, you can use the <br> HTML tag.\n\nFor compatibility, use trailing white space or the <br> HTML tag at the end of the line.\n\nThere are two other options I don’t recommend using. CommonMark and a few other lightweight markup languages let you type a backslash (\\) at the end of the line, but not all Markdown applications support this, so it isn’t a great option from a compatibility perspective. And at least a couple lightweight markup languages don’t require anything at the end of the line — just type return and they’ll create a line break.\n\n\n  \n    \n      ✅  Do this\n      ❌  Don't do this\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          First line with two spaces after.  \n          And the next line.\n\n          First line with the HTML tag after.<br>\n          And the next line.\n        \n      \n      \n        \n        First line with a backslash after.\\\n        And the next line.\n\n        First line with nothing after.\n        And the next line.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nEmphasis\n\nYou can add emphasis by making text bold or italic.\n\nBold\n\nTo bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Markdown\n      HTML\n      Rendered Output\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      I just love **bold text**.\n      I just love <strong>bold text</strong>.\n      I just love bold text.\n    \n    \n      I just love __bold text__.\n      I just love <strong>bold text</strong>.\n      I just love bold text.\n    \n    \n      Love**is**bold Love<strong>is</strong>bold\n      Loveisbold\n    \n  \n\n\nBold Best Practices\n\nMarkdown applications don’t agree on how to handle underscores in the middle of a word.

For compatibility, don’t mix and match delimiters in the same list — pick one and stick with it.\n\n\n  \n    \n      ✅  Do this\n      ❌  Don't do this\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          - First item\n          - Second item\n          - Third item\n          - Fourth item\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          + First item\n          * Second item\n          - Third item\n          + Fourth item\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nAdding Elements in Lists\n\nTo add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab, as shown in the following examples.\n\n\n   Tip: If things don't appear the way you expect, double check that you've indented the elements in the list four spaces or one tab.\n\n\nParagraphs\n\n* This is the first list item.\n* Here's the second list item.\n\n    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.\n\n* And here's the third list item.\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n\n  This is the first list item.\n  \n    Here’s the second list item.\n\n    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.\n  \n  And here’s the third list item.\n\n\nBlockquotes\n\n* This is the first list item.\n* Here's the second list item.\n\n    > A blockquote would look great below the second list item.\n\n* And here's the third list item.\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n\n  This is the first list item.\n  \n    Here’s the second list item.\n\n    \n      A blockquote would look great below the second list item.\n    \n  \n  And here’s the third list item.\n\n\nCode Blocks\n\nCode blocks are normally indented four spaces or one tab.  When they’re in a list, indent them eight spaces or two tabs.\n\n1. Open the file.\n2. Find the following code block on line 21:\n\n        <html>\n          <head>\n            <title>Test</title>\n          </head>\n\n3.

Fourth item\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n\n  First item\n  Second item\n  Third item\n    \n      Indented item\n      Indented item\n    \n  \n  Fourth item\n\n\nCode\n\nTo denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (`).\n\n\n  \n    \n      Markdown\n      HTML\n      Rendered Output\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      At the command prompt, type `nano`.\n      At the command prompt, type <code>nano</code>. \n      At the command prompt, type nano.\n    \n  \n\n\nEscaping Backticks\n\nIf the word or phrase you want to denote as code includes one or more backticks, you can escape it by enclosing the word or phrase in double backticks (``).\n\n\n  \n    \n      Markdown\n      HTML\n      Rendered Output\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      ``Use `code` in your Markdown file.``\n      <code>Use `code` in your Markdown file.</code>\n      Use `code` in your Markdown file.\n    \n  \n\n\nCode Blocks\n\nTo create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab.\n\n    <html>\n      <head>\n      </head>\n    </html>\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n<html>\n  <head>\n  </head>\n</html>\n\n\n\n   Note: To create code blocks without indenting lines, use fenced code blocks.\n\n\nHorizontal Rules\n\nTo create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves.\n\n***\n\n---\n\n_________________\n\n\nThe rendered output of all three looks identical:\n\n\n\nHorizontal Rule Best Practices\n\nFor compatibility, put blank lines before and after horizontal rules.\n\n\n  \n    \n      ✅  Do this\n      ❌  Don't do this\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n        Try to put a blank line before...\n\n        ---\n\n        ...and after a horizontal rule.\n        \n      \n      \n        \n        Without blank lines, this would be a heading.\n        ---\n        Don't do this!\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nLinks\n\nTo create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://duckduckgo.com)).\n\nMy favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nMy favorite search engine is Duck Duck Go.\n\n\n   Note: To link to an element on the same page, see linking to heading IDs. To create a link that opens in a new tab or window, see the section on link targets.\n\n\nAdding Titles\n\nYou can optionally add a title for a link. This will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. To add a title, enclose it in quotation marks after the URL.\n\nMy favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com \"The best search engine for privacy\").\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nMy favorite search engine is Duck Duck Go.\n\nURLs and Email Addresses\n\nTo quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets.\n\n<https://www.markdownguide.org>\n<fake@example.com>\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nhttps://www.markdownguide.org\nfake@example.com\n\nFormatting Links\n\nTo emphasize links, add asterisks before and after the brackets and parentheses. To denote links as code, add backticks in the brackets.\n\nI love supporting the **[EFF](https://eff.org)**.\nThis is the *[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)*.\nSee the section on [`code`](#code).\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nI love supporting the EFF.\nThis is the Markdown Guide.\nSee the section on code.\n\nReference-style Links\n\nReference-style links are a special kind of link that make URLs easier to display and read in Markdown. Reference-style links are constructed in two parts: the part you keep inline with your text and the part you store somewhere else in the file to keep the text easy to read.\n\nFormatting the First Part of the Link\n\nThe first part of a reference-style link is formatted with two sets of brackets. The first set of brackets surrounds the text that should appear linked. The second set of brackets displays a label used to point to the link you’re storing elsewhere in your document.\n\nAlthough not required, you can include a space between the first and second set of brackets. The label in the second set of brackets is not case sensitive and can include letters, numbers, spaces, or punctuation.\n\nThis means the following example formats are roughly equivalent for the first part of the link:\n\n\n  [hobbit-hole][1]\n  [hobbit-hole] [1]\n\n\nFormatting the Second Part of the Link\n\nThe second part of a reference-style link is formatted with the following attributes:\n\n\n  The label, in brackets, followed immediately by a colon and at least one space (e.g., [label]: ).\n  The URL for the link, which you can optionally enclose in angle brackets.\n  The optional title for the link, which you can enclose in double quotes, single quotes, or parentheses.\n\n\nThis means the following example formats are all roughly equivalent for the second part of the link:\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle \"Hobbit lifestyles\"\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle 'Hobbit lifestyles'\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle (Hobbit lifestyles)\n  [1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle> \"Hobbit lifestyles\"\n  [1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle> 'Hobbit lifestyles'\n  [1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle> (Hobbit lifestyles)\n\n\nYou can place this second part of the link anywhere in your Markdown document. Some people place them immediately after the paragraph in which they appear while other people place them at the end of the document (like endnotes or footnotes).\n\nAn Example Putting the Parts Together\n\nSay you add a URL as a standard URL link to a paragraph and it looks like this in Markdown:\n\nIn a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends\nof worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to\neat: it was a [hobbit-hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle \"Hobbit lifestyles\"), and that means comfort.\n\n\nThough it may point to interesting additional information, the URL as displayed really doesn’t add much to the existing raw text other than making it harder to read. To fix that, you could format the URL like this instead:\n\nIn a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends\nof worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to\neat: it was a [hobbit-hole][1], and that means comfort.\n\n[1]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle> \"Hobbit lifestyles\"\n\n\nIn both instances above, the rendered output would be identical:\n\n\n  In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to  eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.\n\n\nand the HTML for the link would be:\n\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle\" title=\"Hobbit lifestyles\">hobbit-hole</a>\n\n\nLink Best Practices\n\nMarkdown applications don’t agree on how to handle spaces in the middle of a URL. For compatibility, try to URL encode any spaces with %20. Alternatively, if your Markdown application supports HTML, you could use the a HTML tag.\n\n\n  \n    \n      ✅  Do this\n      ❌  Don't do this\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n        [link](https://www.example.com/my%20great%20page)\n\n        <a href=\"https://www.example.com/my great page\">link</a>\n        \n      \n      \n        \n        [link](https://www.example.com/my great page)\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nParentheses in the middle of a URL can also be problematic. For compatibility, try to URL encode the opening parenthesis (() with %28 and the closing parenthesis ()) with %29. Alternatively, if your Markdown application supports HTML, you could use the a HTML tag.\n\n\n  \n    \n      ✅  Do this\n      ❌  Don't do this\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n        [a novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Milagro_Beanfield_War_%28novel%29)\n\n        <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Milagro_Beanfield_War_(novel)\">a novel</a>\n        \n      \n      \n        \n        [a novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Milagro_Beanfield_War_(novel))\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nImages\n\nTo add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title in quotation marks after the path or URL.\n\n![The San Juan Mountains are beautiful!](/assets/images/san-juan-mountains.jpg \"San Juan Mountains\")\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n   Note: To resize an image, see the section on image size. To add a caption, see the section on image captions.\n\n\nLinking Images\n\nTo add a link to an image, enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the link in parentheses.\n\n[![An old rock in the desert](/assets/images/shiprock.jpg \"Shiprock, New Mexico by Beau Rogers\")](https://www.flickr.com/photos/beaurogers/31833779864/in/photolist-Qv3rFw-34mt9F-a9Cmfy-5Ha3Zi-9msKdv-o3hgjr-hWpUte-4WMsJ1-KUQ8N-deshUb-vssBD-6CQci6-8AFCiD-zsJWT-nNfsgB-dPDwZJ-bn9JGn-5HtSXY-6CUhAL-a4UTXB-ugPum-KUPSo-fBLNm-6CUmpy-4WMsc9-8a7D3T-83KJev-6CQ2bK-nNusHJ-a78rQH-nw3NvT-7aq2qf-8wwBso-3nNceh-ugSKP-4mh4kh-bbeeqH-a7biME-q3PtTf-brFpgb-cg38zw-bXMZc-nJPELD-f58Lmo-bXMYG-bz8AAi-bxNtNT-bXMYi-bXMY6-bXMYv)\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nEscaping Characters\n\nTo display a literal character that would otherwise be used to format text in a Markdown document, add a backslash (\\) in front of the character.\n\n\\* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.\n\nCharacters You Can Escape\n\nYou can use a backslash to escape the following characters.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Character\n      Name\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \\\n      backslash\n    \n    \n      `\n      backtick (see also escaping backticks in code)\n    \n    \n      *\n      asterisk\n    \n    \n      _\n      underscore\n    \n    \n      { }\n      curly braces\n    \n    \n      [ ]\n      brackets\n    \n    \n      < >\n      angle brackets\n    \n    \n      ( )\n      parentheses\n    \n    \n      #\n      pound sign\n    \n    \n      +\n      plus sign\n    \n    \n      -\n      minus sign (hyphen)\n    \n    \n      .\n      dot\n    \n    \n      !\n      exclamation mark\n    \n    \n      |\n      pipe (see also escaping pipe in tables)\n    \n  \n\n\nHTML\n\nMany Markdown applications allow you to use HTML tags in Markdown-formatted text. This is helpful if you prefer certain HTML tags to Markdown syntax. For example, some people find it easier to use HTML tags for images. Using HTML is also helpful when you need to change the attributes of an element, like specifying the color of text or changing the width of an image.\n\nTo use HTML, place the tags in the text of your Markdown-formatted file.\n\nThis **word** is bold. This <em>word</em> is italic.\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nThis word is bold. This word is italic.\n\nHTML Best Practices\n\nFor security reasons, not all Markdown applications support HTML in Markdown documents. When in doubt, check your Markdown application’s documentation. Some applications support only a subset of HTML tags.\n\nUse blank lines to separate block-level HTML elements like <div>, <table>, <pre>, and <p> from the surrounding content. Try not to indent the tags with tabs or spaces — that can interfere with the formatting.\n\nYou can’t use Markdown syntax inside block-level HTML tags. For example, <p>italic and **bold**</p> won’t work.\n\n\n          \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Take your Markdown skills to the next level.\n        Learn Markdown in 60 pages.

That’s where extended syntax comes in.\n\nSeveral individuals and organizations took it upon themselves to extend the basic syntax by adding additional elements like tables, code blocks, syntax highlighting, URL auto-linking, and footnotes. These elements can be enabled by using a lightweight markup language that builds upon the basic Markdown syntax, or by adding an extension to a compatible Markdown processor.\n\nAvailability\n\nNot all Markdown applications support extended syntax elements. You’ll need to check whether or not the lightweight markup language your application is using supports the extended syntax elements you want to use. If it doesn’t, it may still be possible to enable extensions in your Markdown processor.\n\nLightweight Markup Languages\n\nThere are several lightweight markup languages that are supersets of Markdown. They include basic syntax and build upon it by adding additional elements like tables, code blocks, syntax highlighting, URL auto-linking, and footnotes. Many of the most popular Markdown applications use one of the following lightweight markup languages:\n\n\n  CommonMark\n  GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)\n  Markdown Extra\n  MultiMarkdown\n  R Markdown\n\n\nMarkdown Processors\n\nThere are dozens of Markdown processors available. Many of them allow you to add extensions that enable extended syntax elements. Check your processor’s documentation for more information.\n\nTables\n\nTo add a table, use three or more hyphens (---) to create each column’s header, and use pipes (|) to separate each column. For compatibility, you should also add a pipe on either end of the row.\n\n| Syntax      | Description |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Header      | Title       |\n| Paragraph   | Text        |\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Syntax\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Header\n      Title\n    \n    \n      Paragraph\n      Text\n    \n  \n\n\nCell widths can vary, as shown below. The rendered output will look the same.\n\n| Syntax | Description |\n| --- | ----------- |\n| Header | Title |\n| Paragraph | Text |\n\n\n\n   Tip: Creating tables with hyphens and pipes can be tedious. To speed up the process, try using the Markdown Tables Generator or AnyWayData Markdown Export. Build a table using the graphical interface, and then copy the generated Markdown-formatted text into your file.\n\n\nAlignment\n\nYou can align text in the columns to the left, right, or center by adding a colon (:) to the left, right, or on both side of the hyphens within the header row.\n\n| Syntax      | Description | Test Text     |\n| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |\n| Header      | Title       | Here's this   |\n| Paragraph   | Text        | And more      |\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Syntax\n      Description\n      Test Text\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Header\n      Title\n      Here’s this\n    \n    \n      Paragraph\n      Text\n      And more\n    \n  \n\n\nFormatting Text in Tables\n\nYou can format the text within tables. For example, you can add links, code (words or phrases in backticks (`) only, not code blocks), and emphasis.\n\nYou can’t use headings, blockquotes, lists, horizontal rules, images, or most HTML tags.\n\n\n   Tip: You can use HTML to create line breaks and add lists within table cells.\n\n\nEscaping Pipe Characters in Tables\n\nYou can display a pipe (|) character in a table by using its HTML character code (&#124;).\n\nFenced Code Blocks\n\nThe basic Markdown syntax allows you to create code blocks by indenting lines by four spaces or one tab. If you find that inconvenient, try using fenced code blocks. Depending on your Markdown processor or editor, you’ll use three backticks (```) or three tildes (~~~) on the lines before and after the code block. The best part? You don’t have to indent any lines!\n\n```\n{\n  \"firstName\": \"John\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n  \"age\": 25\n}\n```\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n{\n  \"firstName\": \"John\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n  \"age\": 25\n}\n\n\n\n   Tip: Need to display backticks inside a code block? See this section to learn how to escape them.\n\n\nSyntax Highlighting\n\nMany Markdown processors support syntax highlighting for fenced code blocks. This feature allows you to add color highlighting for whatever language your code was written in. To add syntax highlighting, specify a language next to the backticks before the fenced code block.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"firstName\": \"John\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n  \"age\": 25\n}\n```\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n{\n  \"firstName\": \"John\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n  \"age\": 25\n}\n\n\nFootnotes\n\nFootnotes allow you to add notes and references without cluttering the body of the document. When you create a footnote, a superscript number with a link appears where you added the footnote reference. Readers can click the link to jump to the content of the footnote at the bottom of the page.\n\nTo create a footnote reference, add a caret and an identifier inside brackets ([^1]). Identifiers can be numbers or words, but they can’t contain spaces or tabs. Identifiers only correlate the footnote reference with the footnote itself — in the output, footnotes are numbered sequentially.\n\nAdd the footnote using another caret and number inside brackets with a colon and text ([^1]: My footnote.). You don’t have to put footnotes at the end of the document. You can put them anywhere except inside other elements like lists, block quotes, and tables.\n\nHere's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]\n\n[^1]: This is the first footnote.\n\n[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.\n\n    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.\n\n    `{ my code }`\n\n    Add as many paragraphs as you like.\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nHere’s a simple footnote,1 and here’s a longer one.2\n\n\n  \n    \n      This is the first footnote. ↩\n    \n    \n      Here’s one with multiple paragraphs and code.\n\n      Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.\n\n      { my code }\n\n      Add as many paragraphs as you like. ↩\n    \n  \n\n\nHeading IDs\n\nMany Markdown processors support custom IDs for headings — some Markdown processors automatically add them. Adding custom IDs allows you to link directly to headings and modify them with CSS. To add a custom heading ID, enclose the custom ID in curly braces on the same line as the heading.\n\n### My Great Heading {#custom-id}\n\n\nThe HTML looks like this:\n\n<h3 id=\"custom-id\">My Great Heading</h3>\n\n\nLinking to Heading IDs\n\nYou can link to headings with custom IDs in the file by creating a standard link with a number sign (#) followed by the custom heading ID. These are commonly referred to as anchor links.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Markdown\n      HTML\n      Rendered Output\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      [Heading IDs](#heading-ids)\n       <a href=\"#heading-ids\">Heading IDs</a>\n      Heading IDs\n    \n  \n\n\nOther websites can link to the heading by adding the custom heading ID to the full URL of the webpage (e.g, [Heading IDs](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax#heading-ids)).\n\nDefinition Lists\n\nSome Markdown processors allow you to create definition lists of terms and their corresponding definitions. To create a definition list, type the term on the first line. On the next line, type a colon followed by a space and the definition.\n\nFirst Term\n: This is the definition of the first term.\n\nSecond Term\n: This is one definition of the second term.\n: This is another definition of the second term.\n\n\nThe HTML looks like this:\n\n<dl>\n  <dt>First Term</dt>\n  <dd>This is the definition of the first term.</dd>\n  <dt>Second Term</dt>\n  <dd>This is one definition of the second term. </dd>\n  <dd>This is another definition of the second term.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n\n  First Term\n  This is the definition of the first term.\n  Second Term\n  This is one definition of the second term.\n  This is another definition of the second term.\n\n\nStrikethrough\n\nYou can strikethrough words by putting a horizontal line through the center of them. The result looks like this. This feature allows you to indicate that certain words are a mistake not meant for inclusion in the document. To strikethrough words, use two tilde symbols (~~) before and after the words.\n\n~~The world is flat.~~ We now know that the world is round.\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nThe world is flat. We now know that the world is round.\n\nTask Lists\n\nTask lists (also referred to as checklists and todo lists) allow you to create a list of items with checkboxes. In Markdown applications that support task lists, checkboxes will be displayed next to the content. To create a task list, add dashes (-) and brackets with a space ([ ]) in front of task list items. To select a checkbox, add an x in between the brackets ([x]).\n\n- [x] Write the press release\n- [ ] Update the website\n- [ ] Contact the media\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n\n\nEmoji\n\nThere are two ways to add emoji to Markdown files: copy and paste the emoji into your Markdown-formatted text, or type emoji shortcodes.\n\nCopying and Pasting Emoji\n\nIn most cases, you can simply copy an emoji from a source like Emojipedia and paste it into your document. Many Markdown applications will automatically display the emoji in the Markdown-formatted text. The HTML and PDF files you export from your Markdown application should display the emoji.\n\n\n   Tip: If you're using a static site generator, make sure you encode HTML pages as UTF-8.\n\n\nUsing Emoji Shortcodes\n\nSome Markdown applications allow you to insert emoji by typing emoji shortcodes. These begin and end with a colon and include the name of an emoji.\n\nGone camping! :tent: Be back soon.\n\nThat is so funny! :joy:\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nGone camping! ⛺ Be back soon.\n\nThat is so funny! 😂\n\n\n   Note: You can use this list of emoji shortcodes, but keep in mind that emoji shortcodes vary from application to application. Refer to your Markdown application's documentation for more information.\n\n\nHighlight\n\nThis isn’t common, but some Markdown processors allow you to highlight text. The result looks like this. To highlight words, use two equal signs (==) before and after the words.\n\nI need to highlight these ==very important words==.\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nI need to highlight these very important words.\n\nAlternatively, if your Markdown application supports HTML, you can use the mark HTML tag.\n\nI need to highlight these <mark>very important words</mark>.\n\n\nSubscript\n\nThis isn’t common, but some Markdown processors allow you to use subscript to position one or more characters slightly below the normal line of type. To create a subscript, use one tilde symbol (~) before and after the characters.\n\nH~2~O\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nH2O\n\n\n   Tip: Be sure to test this in your Markdown application before using it. Some Markdown applications use one tilde symbol before and after words not for subscript, but for strikethrough. \n\n\nAlternatively, if your Markdown application supports HTML, you can use the sub HTML tag.\n\nH<sub>2</sub>O\n\n\nSuperscript\n\nThis isn’t common, but some Markdown processors allow you to use superscript to position one or more characters slightly above the normal line of type. To create a superscript, use one caret symbol (^) before and after the characters.\n\nX^2^\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nX2\n\nAlternatively, if your Markdown application supports HTML, you can use the sup HTML tag.\n\nX<sup>2</sup>\n\n\nAutomatic URL Linking\n\nMany Markdown processors automatically turn URLs into links. That means if you type http://www.example.com, your Markdown processor will automatically turn it into a link even though you haven’t used brackets.\n\nhttp://www.example.com\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nhttp://www.example.com\n\nDisabling Automatic URL Linking\n\nIf you don’t want a URL to be automatically linked, you can remove the link by denoting the URL as code with backticks.\n\n`http://www.example.com`\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nhttp://www.example.com\n\n\n          \n  \n    \n      \n        \n\n\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Take your Markdown skills to the next level.\n        Learn Markdown in 60 pages.

But chances are that if you use Markdown long enough, you’ll inevitably discover that it doesn’t support something you need. This page provides tips and tricks for working around Markdown’s limitations.\n\n\n   Tip: These hacks aren't guaranteed to work in your Markdown application. If you need to use these hacks frequently, you should consider writing using something other than Markdown. \n\n\nUnderline\n\nUnderlined text is not something you typically see in web writing, probably because underlined text is nearly synonymous with links. However, if you’re writing a paper or a report, you may need the ability to underline words and phrases. A couple of applications like Bear and Simplenote provide support for underlining text, but Markdown doesn’t natively support underlining. If your Markdown processor supports HTML, you can use the <ins> HTML tag to underline text in your document.\n\nSome of these words <ins>will be underlined</ins>.\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nSome of these words will be underlined.\n\nIndent (Tab)\n\nTabs and whitespace have a special meaning in Markdown. You can use trailing whitespace to create line breaks, and you can use tabs to create code blocks. But what if you need to indent a paragraph the old-fashioned way, using the tab key? Markdown doesn’t provide an easy way of doing that.\n\nYour best bet might be to use a Markdown editor that supports indentation. This is common in applications that are more oriented towards desktop publishing. For example, iA Writer allows you to customize indentation settings for the editor in the application preferences. It also provides template customization options so that you can make the rendered document look the way you expect it to, indentation and all.\n\nAnother option, if your Markdown processor supports HTML, is to use the HTML entity for non-breaking space (&nbsp;). This should probably be your option of last resort as it can get awkward. Basically, every &nbsp; in your Markdown source will be replaced with a space in the rendered output. So if you stick four instances of &nbsp; before a paragraph, the paragraph will look like it’s indented four spaces.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first sentence of my indented paragraph.\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n    This is the first sentence of my indented paragraph.\n\nCenter\n\nHaving the ability to center text is a necessity when writing a paper or a report. Unfortunately, Markdown doesn’t have any concept of text alignment (one possible exception is when using tables). The good news is that there’s an HTML tag you can use: <center>. If your Markdown processor supports HTML, you can place these tags around whatever text you want to center align.\n\n<center>This text is centered.</center>\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nThis text is centered.\n\nThe <center> HTML tag is technically supported but officially deprecated, which means it works for now but you’re not supposed to be using it. Unfortunately, there’s not another pure HTML alternative. You could try using one of the CSS alternatives. Not all Markdown applications provide CSS support, but if the one you’re using does, here’s an alternative to the <center> tag:\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">Center this text</p>\n\n\nIf this is supported by your Markdown application, the output looks like this:\n\nCenter this text\n\nColor\n\nMarkdown doesn’t allow you to change the color of text, but if your Markdown processor supports HTML, you can use the <font> HTML tag. The color attribute allows you to specify the font color using a color’s name or the hexadecimal #RRGGBB code.\n\n<font color=\"red\">This text is red!</font>\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nThis text is red!\n\nThe <font> HTML tag is technically supported but officially deprecated, which means it works for now but you’re not supposed to be using it. Unfortunately, there’s not another pure HTML alternative. You could try using one of the CSS alternatives. Not all Markdown applications provide CSS support, but if the one you’re using does, here’s an alternative to the <font> tag:\n\n<p style=\"color:blue\">Make this text blue.</p>\n\n\nIf this is supported by your Markdown application, the output looks like this:\n\nMake this text blue.\n\nComments\n\nSome people need the ability to write sentences in their Markdown files that will not appear in the rendered output. These comments are essentially hidden text. The text is viewable by the author of the document, but it’s not printed on the webpage or PDF. Markdown doesn’t natively support comments, but several enterprising individuals have devised a solution.\n\nTo add a comment, place text inside brackets followed by a colon, a space, and a pound sign (e.g., [comment]: #). You should put blank lines before and after a comment.\n\nHere's a paragraph that will be visible.\n\n[This is a comment that will be hidden.]: # \n\nAnd here's another paragraph that's visible.\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nHere’s a paragraph that will be visible.\n\nAnd here’s another paragraph that’s visible.\n\n\n   Tip: This tip comes from Stack Overflow. It's been peer-reviewed and used by thousands of people!\n\n\nAdmonitions\n\nAdmonitions are frequently used in documentation to call attention to warnings, notes, and tips. Markdown doesn’t provide special syntax for admonitions, and most Markdown applications don’t provide support for admonitions (one exception is MkDocs).\n\nHowever, if you need to add admonitions, you might be able to use blockquotes with emoji and emphasis to create something that looks similar to the admonitions you see on other websites.\n\n> :warning: **Warning:** Do not push the big red button.\n\n> :memo: **Note:** Sunrises are beautiful.\n\n> :bulb: **Tip:** Remember to appreciate the little things in life.\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n\n  ⚠️ Warning: Do not push the big red button.\n\n\n\n  📝 Note: Sunrises are beautiful.\n\n\n\n  💡 Tip: Remember to appreciate the little things in life.\n\n\nImage Size\n\nThe Markdown syntax for images doesn’t allow you to specify the width and height of images. If you need to resize an image and your Markdown processor supports HTML, you can use the img HTML tag with the width and height attributes to set the dimensions of an image in pixels.\n\n<img src=\"image.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"100\">\n\n\nThe rendered output will contain the image resized to the dimensions you specified.\n\nImage Captions\n\nMarkdown doesn’t natively support image captions, but there are two possible workarounds. If your Markdown application supports HTML, you can use the figure and figcaption HTML tags to add a caption for your image.\n\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/albuquerque.jpg\"\n         alt=\"Albuquerque, New Mexico\">\n    <figcaption>A single track trail outside of Albuquerque, New Mexico.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n\n    \n\n\n    A single track trail outside of Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\n\n\n   Tip: If your Markdown application supports CSS, you can use CSS to style the appearance of the caption.\n\n\nIf your Markdown application doesn’t support HTML, you could try placing the caption directly below the image and using emphasis.\n\n![Albuquerque, New Mexico](/assets/images/albuquerque.jpg)\n*A single track trail outside of Albuquerque, New Mexico.*\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n\n\nA single track trail outside of Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nLink Targets\n\nSome people like creating links that open in new tabs or windows. The Markdown syntax for links doesn’t allow you to specify the target attribute, but if your Markdown processor supports HTML, you can use HTML to create these  links.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.markdownguide.org\" target=\"_blank\">Learn Markdown!</a>\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nLearn Markdown!\n\nSymbols\n\nMarkdown doesn’t provide special syntax for symbols. However, in most cases, you can copy and paste whatever symbol you want to use into your Markdown document. For example, if you need to display Pi (π), just find the symbol on a webpage and copy and paste it into your document. The symbol should appear as expected in the rendered output.\n\nAlternatively, if your Markdown application supports HTML, you can use the HTML entity for whatever symbol you want to use. For example, if you want to display the copyright sign (©), you can copy and paste the HTML entity for copyright (&copy;) into your Markdown document.\n\nHere’s a partial list of HTML entities for symbols:\n\n\n  Copyright (©) — &copy;\n  Registered trademark (®) — &reg;\n  Trademark (™) — &trade;\n  Euro (€) — &euro;\n  Left arrow (←) — &larr;\n  Up arrow (↑) — &uarr;\n  Right arrow (→) — &rarr;\n  Down arrow (↓) — &darr;\n  Degree (°) — &#176;\n  Pi (π) — &#960;\n\n\nFor a complete list of available HTML entities, refer to Wikipedia’s page on HTML entities.\n\nTable Formatting\n\nMarkdown tables are notoriously finicky. You can’t use many Markdown syntax elements to format the text in table cells. But there are workarounds for at least two common table issues: Line breaks and lists.\n\nLine Breaks Within Table Cells\n\nYou can separate paragraphs within a table cell by using one or more <br> HTML tags.\n\n| Syntax      | Description |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Header      | Title |\n| Paragraph   | First paragraph. <br><br> Second paragraph. |\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Syntax\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Header\n      Title\n    \n    \n      Paragraph\n      First paragraph.  Second paragraph.\n    \n  \n\n\nLists Within Table Cells\n\nYou can add a list within a table cell by using HTML tags.\n\n| Syntax      | Description |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Header      | Title |\n| List        | Here's a list! <ul><li>Item one.</li><li>Item two.</li></ul> |\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n\n  \n    \n      Syntax\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Header\n      Title\n    \n    \n      List\n      Here's a list! Item one.Item two.\n    \n  \n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSome Markdown applications like Markdeep can automatically generate a table of contents (also referred to as a toc) from your headings, but this isn’t a feature provided by all Markdown applications. However, if your Markdown application supports heading IDs, you can create a table of contents for your Markdown file using a list and some links.\n\n#### Table of Contents\n\n- [Underline](#underline)\n- [Indent](#indent)\n- [Center](#center)\n- [Color](#color)\n\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n  Underline\n  Indent\n  Center\n  Color\n\n\nVideos\n\nIf your Markdown application supports HTML, you should be able to embed a video in your Markdown file by copying and pasting the HTML code provided by a video website like YouTube or Vimeo. If your Markdown application doesn’t support HTML, you can’t embed a video, but you can come close by adding an image and a link to the video. You could do this with practically any video on any video service.\n\nSince YouTube makes this easy, we’ll use them as an example. Take this video, for instance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q2IjQOzVpE. The last part of the URL (8q2IjQOzVpE) is the ID of the video.
